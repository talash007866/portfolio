                    Hello! I’m a first-year B.Tech student with a deep passion for web development and coding. Although
                    I’m at the beginning of my journey, I’m already diving into the world of Java DSA to strengthen my
                    problem-solving abilities. I've successfully completed learning frontend technologies and have a
                    solid grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Right now, I’m expanding my knowledge and skills in
                    backend development, tackling challenges with databases, server-side logic, and APIs.

                    Even though my projects are still a work in progress, I’m learning continuously and getting better
                    every day. My goal is to build meaningful and innovative projects as I move forward in my studies.
                    The journey may have just begun, but I’m eager to develop and refine my skills to contribute to the
                    tech world in the future. Stay tuned for some exciting work in the coming years!

                <p>As a first-year BTech student, I am currently exploring web development and honing my skills in
                    front-end technologies. While I'm still in the learning phase, I have built several website clones
                    to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though these projects are not yet fully functional, they
                    showcase my growing understanding of web design and structure. I'm eager to enhance my skills and
                    work on more advanced projects in the future.</p>
